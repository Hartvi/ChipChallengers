ChipChallengers - physics chips and programming all in one

### TODO
- fix cosmetics - explicitly label which objects are targets of colouring through *layers* or *object names* or otherwise
- rotate the camera around the currently selected object or add an option for it
- copy paste in editor - add the option to paste mirror-wise `ctrl+shift+v`

### Done
- +++ fix bug in `EditorMenu`; line: 111
- + test jet 
- + orbiting camera mode in editor
- + ctrl+v in editor
- ++ createchippanel must be completely on screen when activated
- +++ LUA should only show error on screen when it encounters an error in the editor and playmode. Right now it throws an exception that stops the whole program
